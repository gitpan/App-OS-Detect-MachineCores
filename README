NAME
    mcores - Executable for App::OS::Detect::MachineCores

VERSION
    version 0.015

SYNOPSIS
    On different systems, different approaches are needed to detect the
    number of cores for that machine.

    This Module is a wrapper around these different approaches.

USAGE
    This is the executable to App::OS::Detect::MachineCores, please see the
    documentation there for usage.

WARNING
    Some questions with Dist::Zilla are still open, and although this module
    attempts to load Mouse instead of Moose, unfortuantely, however, both
    modules are installed as prerequisites. This will change soon.
