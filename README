NAME
    App::OS::Detect::MachineCores - Detect how many cores your machine has
    (OS-independently)

VERSION
    version 0.011

SYNOPSIS
    On different systems, different approaches are needed to detect the
    number of cores for that machine.

    This Module is a wrapper around these different approaches.

USAGE
    This module will install one executable, "mcores", in your bin.

    It is really simple and straightforward:

         usage: mcores [-?i] [long options...]
             -? --usage --help  Prints this usage information.
             -i --add-one       add one to the number of cores (useful in scripts)

WARNING
    Some questions with Dist::Zilla are still open, and although this module
    attempts to load Mouse instead of Moose, unfortuantely, however, both
    modules are installed as prerequisites. This will change soon.
