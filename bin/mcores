=head1 NAME

mcores - Executable for App::OS::Detect::MachineCores

=head1 VERSION

version 0.012

=head1 SYNOPSIS

On different systems, different approaches are needed to detect the number of cores for that machine.

This Module is a wrapper around these different approaches.

=head1 USAGE

This is the executable to L<App::OS::Detect::MachineCores>, please see the documentation there for usage.

=head1 WARNING

Some questions with Dist::Zilla are still open, and although this module attempts to load L<Mouse> instead of L<Moose>,
unfortuantely, however, B<both> modules are installed as prerequisites. This will change soon.
